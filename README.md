# E-commerce-site-
Application created for my Bachelor's degree

The application's back-end was developed using npm packages(as @nuxtjs/auth, dotenv, or multer-s3) and several database connections using MongoDB, Amazon S3, and Algolia. For the front-end, I used Vue.js for visuals and Nuxt.js for making the site a single page application.

Product images are stored in Amazon S3's cloud, users and product data are stored in a MongoDB database and product data is also used by Algolia for indexing the products, index needed for the search engine.
